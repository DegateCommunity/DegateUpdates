# Degate updates repository

## Explanations

This repository store Degate updates. It's here every maintenance tool (see Qt Installer Framework) will check for new updates. There is two "channels" : a release one and a nightly one. The release channel store only updates for full releases and the nightly channel store all updates (releases and pre-releases).

## Create a release/pre-release

To create a release/pre-release you need to:
- Change the version in the VERSION file of the main Degate repository.
- Trigger manually the two github actions : "Windows deploy" and "Linux deploy".
- Create a new release/pre-release with the proper version tag.
- Upload all artifacts generated by the two github actions EXCEPT updates ones.
- Extract update artifacts here, in proper folders (OS/release OR nightly/configuration).
- Publish the release/pre-release.

Update release and nightly channels for every release (just paste generated artifacts content in the proper folder(s), don't forget to delete previous content), but update only nightly channel for pre-release. A pre-release version is a version of the form 'X.X.X-[alpha|beta|rc].X' and a release version will have the form 'X.X.X'.
